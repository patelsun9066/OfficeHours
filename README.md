Introduction:
During my academic journey here at OSU I have encountered difficult subjects in my coursework 
that has caused me deep frustration and even at times crippling imposter syndrome. In these moments 
of pearl, I`ve always leaned on office hours as a avenue to seek educational help as well as mentorship 
from teaching assistants and professors. Quite frankly, these moments of encouragement and positive 
reinforcement are the only reason I`m still enrolled in the computer science program! Just when I was 
ready to call it quits and drop out of the program, I`ve been struck by a timely soft touch from a 
professor or TA that gave me the perseverance and strength to keep going. For this reason, as I approach 
the finish line towards graduation its very important to me on a personal level that I help leave the OSU 
ecampus community and its workflows in a better state than when I arrived. Given how important office 
hours have been to my success, I began to analyze the different office hour setups I`ve encountered for 
areas of deficiency or improvement . Overwhelmingly from a student perspective the greatest area for 
improvement has to be related to the announcement and tracking of week-to-week office hour 
schedules throughout the semester. TA`s and professors, for a variety of reasons, have to adjust office 
hour schedules throughout the quarter and as a result of these last-minute shifts create a garden variety 
of issues for students. issues such as: canvas help session schedules becoming inaccurate, empty 
Microsoft teams channels when students thought a TA would be present, or even difficulty determining 
and synchronizing offices hours across multiple courses are just some of the issues observed. To remedy 
this problem, the solution proposed is to create a sole source portal that allows TA`s and professors to 
enter and update their office hours accordingly throughout the quarter, thus streamlining the office hour 
reporting process and reducing confusion. Respectively, students will be able to access this portal to view 
upcoming and available office hours for each of their enrolled courses, thus making it easier for them 
accurately track and plan for office hours!
Features and Functionality:
As briefly discussed above the core objective of this product is to help distinct two user groups: 
a.) TA`s/Professors – this user group will be responsible for providing accurate inputs on their available 
office hours throughout the quarter b.) Students – this user group will be able to quickly view the 
available office hours for each of there courses in a consolidated manner. The finished product will 
provide value to both of these user groups by helping reduce confusion, miscommunications, and 
wasted time. As of right now most teaching assistants and professors host office hours on Microsoft 
teams, and typically will make an announcement that hits student`s outlook email to let them know their 
office hours are live. This workflow of announcing live office hours is a flawed process, if students fail to 
check their email or if TA`s/professors forget to make the announcement there is no way for students to 
know if and when office hours are being held! Additionally, TA`s/professors consistently having to make
canvas and Microsoft teams announcements is an inefficient use of there limited time, as well as a 
potential point of confusion since announcements might end up overlaying prior announcements in 
students inboxes. For these reasons, the TA`s/professor user group will benefit greatly from inputting all 
their office hours into this product, as it will help 1.) save time since office hour schedules will only have 
to be entered once, with updates when necessary 2.) help reduce confusion since this portal will serve as 
the master schedule that is dynamic and live, thus making no announcements is necessary. TA`s and 
professors will interact with the finished product by utilizing clearly labeled, intuitive, and directed 
workflows to help construct/enter in office hour time slots. The value of this product will be reliant on 
this user group helping provide and maintain an accurate information stream. Furthermore, the second 
user group of users, students, will be the real net beneficiaries of this product`s functionality! Once 
TA`s/professors populate office hour’s at the beginning of the quarter, students will have a live 
consolidated view of all office hours across all of their enrolled courses in one centralized location. The 
benefits of this are tremendously valuable as students will one.) Save precious time and incur less stress 
during intense work weeks trying to figure out how/when to access help resources two.) be able to plan 
attending multiple help sessions more effectively when enrolled in multiple classes they need help in. 
Students will interact with the finished product by simply filtering and navigating to their enrolled 
courses, which on presentation will hopefully give them all the information they need for getting 
immediate academic help. Overall, I hope that it is evident that building this product has the potential to 
impact the academic journey of a lot of students at OSU, something that excites me.
